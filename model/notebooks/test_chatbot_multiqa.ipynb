The purpose of this inspirational program is to highlight the unique skill set and leadership capabilities of our country’s most talented Veterans, as they work in conjunction with local citizens, businesses and contractors who are passionate about rebuilding this great country from the ground up.  Update:  Provided a letter of encouragement to Mark Burnett productions for this project.  Next Step, the executive producers will be seeking a network studio for distribution.

Navy and its Marine Corps partner\\'s mission to protect and defend more complex and challenging than ever before. \\n\\nPotential enemies are developing new and more sophisticated weaponry, nuclear submarines, and other ships of war, while terrorist organizations are devising new and different suicide and other missions with small craft that can inflict great damage in shallow waters. Pirates threaten commercial shipping lanes, and drug lords ship their illegal contraband in our territorial waters. \\n\\nKeenly aware of the ever evolving new threats, the Navy has responded with a strategy (Navy 21) to meet these new challenges, including the development of new assets which can deal with them most effectively. Unfortunately, neither the congress nor the public is sufficiently informed of the nature or seriousness of these new threats, which has been a factor in eroding the strong support our military needs keep us safe and secure. \\n\\nProposal \\n\\nThe \"SEAPOWER - 3D 1MAX Experience\" documentary film will educate key domestic and global audiences regarding the challenges of addressing the significantly different and varied new military challenges of the post 9/11 world.
