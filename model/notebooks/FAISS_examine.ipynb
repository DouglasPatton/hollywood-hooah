Per OSD-PA, due to the broad request currently being reviewed, the focus of the project was telling the stories of our personnel in CONUS locations. The thought is to incorporate the filming with training rotations/exercises. The producer is re-evaluating the request to pair it down to what the services can support and provide more specific details.

No personnel will be featured in the broadcast, though they may be shown in the background as celebrities enter the event. Following the red carpet events, the personnel will be moved to a theater to watch the ceremony on a live broadcast. OCPA-LA coordinated with the 311th ESC to provide the oversight of the event.   Coordination with USMA: OCPA-LA worked with Public Affairs staff at USMA for two potential upcoming productions. The first is a proposed Netflix production with a request to follow four Plebes from the day they report to the end of their first year. This request is up at USMA Public Affairs for review with their leadership. The second is a request from  production company, Hello Sunshine, for a program that would follow Cadet  to highlight women in leadership positions at the Academy. OCPA-LA proposed to the production that they follow additional female leaders at the Academy. OCPA-LA is continuing to work with the production company and OSD-PA for the Production Assistance Agreement.  Los Angeles Angels: OCPA-LA is coordinating with the Los Angeles Angels for Army representation at some home games in April. The team recognizes service members at Friday and Saturday home games, and April has been designated as the Army’s month. We are coordinating with local Army units; LA Recruiting Battalion, 79th TSC, and 311th ESC; for representation at the six games that month.  White Sands Missile Range Coordination: OCPA-LA is coordinating with WSMR for an episode of “National Geographic Explorer”. WSMR is looking to give “unprecedented access” to facilities and testing for the episode. This access could include “our large blast facility and possibly a shot, our laser facility complete with a shot, and take them through all the most photogenic steps of missile testing, essentially compressing a year of rocket science into a couple days.” More to follow after further coordination between WSMR and NatGeo.

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size. To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals. As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path,  teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend. \\n\\n• Background: OCPA-LA reviewed two versions of the script and met with the director and Warner Bros.’ VP for Public Affairs and declined to support the production. The decision to decline support was based on the failure to incorporate script notes provided by OCPA-LA into the revised draft of the script. The notes provided dealt with creating a more accurate depiction of the U.S. Army and the Army National Guard in the production. In the scripts provided to OCPA-LA, nearly all Army and Army National Guard personnel and equipment were killed or destroyed by the genetically altered animals with no chance of success in their missions. The overall chain of command structure was inaccurate, and the Army characters were based on inaccurate stereotypes of the Army. \\n\\n  “Sicario: Day of the Soldado” \\n\\n• Release Date: 29 JUN 2018 \\n\\n• Distributor: Sony \\n\\n• Official Synopsis: The drug war on the U.S./Mexico border has escalated as the cartels have begun trafficking terrorists into the United States.

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size. To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals. As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Background: OCPA-LA reviewed two versions of the script and met with \\n\\nthe director and Warner Bros.’ VP for Public Affairs and declined to support the production. The decision to decline support was based on the failure to incorporate script notes provided by OCPA-LA into the revised draft of the script. The notes provided dealt with creating a more accurate depiction of the U.S. Army and the Army National Guard in the production. In the scripts provided to OCPA-LA, nearly all Army and Army National Guard personnel and equipment were killed or destroyed by the genetically altered animals with no chance of success in their missions. The overall chain of command structure was inaccurate, and the Army characters were based on inaccurate stereotypes of the Army. \\n\\n  “Sicario: Day of the Soldado” \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Release Date: 29 JUN 2018 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Distributor: Sony \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Official Synopsis: The drug war on the U.S./Mexico border has escalated \\n\\nas the cartels have begun trafficking terrorists into the United States.

The Air Force allowed Banyan Productions to film in military family housing at McGuire AFB, NJ. The special episode is called \"Trading Spaces: Operation Home Base\" and airs 3 December at 2100 hours on TLC. The \"Trading Spaces\" talent held improptu photograph sessions while videotaping at the Air Mobility Warfare Center and Falcon Courts North housing. The KC-l 0 flight simulator shoot went especially well; the Boeing folks and its Air Force liaison juggled schedules to open up time to shoot the show teaser inside the simulator. Though it was officially an Armed Forces Entertainment show, +/-1,000 people attended a concert by country singer Aaron Tippin thanks to an extremely well-planned event by the 305th Services Squadron. -- Fear Factor (NBC): The 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews AFB has two NCOs selected for an all-military \"Fear Factor\" shooting 5 - IO Dec 05 (Show is not supported by AF or DoD).

The script has been reviewed by SAF/PAYE and notes have been provided to the producer. We provided producer C-17 flying hour costs which may scuttle our participation. He objects to the daily minimum activity charge, which in the case ofthe C-17 amounts to a minimum of $21,600.00 per day whether the plane flies or not. With AMCIPA\\'s guidance we provided OASDIPA clarification last week as to why the cost of the C-17 is twice that of the C-5, whether the aircraft flies or not. Mr. Strub was not satisfied and projects that such costs could rule out Air Force participation in future films involving cargo aircraft.

Seems the Congressman likes to give these medals out anddoesn’t want the military around for the presentation of a military award. Asked tocover the event and publicize it in the internal Army media since receiving a SilverStar is a big deal and the Army has been a major supporter in publicizing theVeterans History Project but was also denied. FYI, Mr. McEachin is receiving thismedal for the first time because he just learned that he had qualified for it through theintercession of Cong. Dreir~s office with the Archives in Saint Louis.
