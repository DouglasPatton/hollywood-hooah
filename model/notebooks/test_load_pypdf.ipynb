In these \\ncircumstances, DoD shall not be liable, financially or otherwise, for any resulting negative \\nimpact or prejudice to the production caused by the premature withdrawal or change in support \\nto the production company. \\n4. There shall be no deviation from established DoD safety and conduct standards. The DoD \\nproject officer or his or her designee shall coordinate such standards and compliance therewith. \\nDoD shall provide the production company advance notice of such safety or conduct standards \\nupon request. \\n5. All DoD property or facilities damaged, used or altered by the production company in \\nconnection with the production shall be restored by the production company to the same or better \\ncondition, normal wear and tear excepted, as when they were made available for the production \\ncompany\\'s use. \\n6. The production company shall reimburse the U.S. Government for any additional expenses \\nincurred as a result of the assistance rendered for the production of \"21st  Century Carrier.\" \\nThe estimated amount shall be detailed and included (e.g., \"see Attachment 2,\" etc.). The \\nproduction company shall be charged for only those expenses that are considered to be additional \\ncosts to DoD in excess of those that would otherwise have been incurred, such as fuel, resultant \\ndepot maintenance, expendable supplies, travel and per diem, civilian overtime, and lost or \\ndamaged equipment. \\n7. The production company shall be charged for the travel, lodging, per diem and incidental \\nexpenses for the DoD project officer, the DoD Documentary Officer or his or her designee, and \\nany other assigned military technical and safety advisor(s) whose presence may be required by \\nDoD. The per diem will be at the federal rate, and accordingly, the production company will not \\nbe required to report it to the Internal Revenue Service (via W-2), and therefore DoD personnel \\nwill not be obliged to submit a form 1099. For each of these individuals, the production \\ncompany shall provide: \\na.
