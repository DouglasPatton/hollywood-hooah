## Retrieval Augmented Generative Chat

#### Overview
Welcome to the repository for my chatbot. This chatbot uses a retrieval augmented generative (RAG) chatbot architecture to help researchers understand a dense collection of documents detailing collaboration between the US Department of Defense and entertainment companies.

The database of documents that the chatbot uses are currently private and available upon request from Professor Roger Stahl. Learn more about his research through his excellent documentary, [Theaters of War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11841496/)
