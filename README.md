## Retrieval Augmented Generative Chat

#### Overview
Welcome to the repository for my chatbot. This chatbot uses a retrieval augmented generative (RAG) chatbot architecture to help researchers understand a dense collection of documents detailing collaboration between the US Department of Defense and entertainment companies.

The database of documents that the chatbot uses are currently private, but a website is in the works. The documents are curated and controlled by Professor Roger Stahl at the University of Georgia; If you are a researcher interested in the documents, please reach out to me. You can learn more about Prof. Stahl's research through his excellent documentary, [Theaters of War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11841496/).
